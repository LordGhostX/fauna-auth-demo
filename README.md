# Fauna User Identity and Session Management + Flask Demo

This is a Python + Flask demo application to showcase Fauna's built-in user identity and session management capabilities as shown in the [documentation.](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/tutorials/authentication/user)

The `user-interface` directory contains only the user interface of the Flask application that will be implementing Fauna's user authentication.

The `fauna-integration` directory contains the full application (Fauna + Flask) that implements Fauna's user authentication.

The tutorial for this repository exists on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/LordGhostX/)
