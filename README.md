# Fauna User Identity and Session Management + Flask Demo

This is a Python + Flask demo application to showcase Fauna's built-in user identity and session management capabilities as shown in the [documentation](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/tutorials/authentication/user).

The `user-interface` directory contains only the user interface of the Flask application that will be implementing Fauna's user authentication.

The `fauna-integration` directory contains the full application (Fauna + Flask) that implements Fauna's user authentication.

You can also check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/LordGhostX/9d70357f9803904506939ab6f4bb3a9a) that implements Fauna's user authentication in Python.

The tutorial for this repository exists on [LordGhostX's blog](https://dev.to/lordghostx/managing-user-authentication-and-sessions-with-fauna-and-flask-5h5h).
